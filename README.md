### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Frontend Developer, I trained at Platzi in the Web Development and JavaScript school. I have experience doing personal projects. I am passionate about learning and always being updated to improve both my technical skills and my soft skills. I also like to teach and work in a team sharing the knowledge acquired.
